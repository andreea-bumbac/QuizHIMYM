This is a quiz about the show "How I met your mother".
I used C# for backend, Windows Forms for frontend and Sqlite for data base.
It allowes you to log in as a user by introducing your username and password, then a new page opens and you can see your points, your badges with characters from the show,
a ranking table with best users. In the middle, you have a question and 3 possible answers. If you choose the correct one than it will become green, otherwise it will turn 
red. Than a new question will show up. If you give a correct answer than your points will grow, and if you have enough points, you will recive a new badge.
You can also add a new question to the quiz in the data base by introducing the question, 3 possible answers, and saying which is the correct one.
